    <h2>Brexit Live Updates: U.K. Parliament to Vote on Theresa May’s Departure Deal</h2><p>

    <h3>With Britain in political crisis and a new deadline to leave the European Union two weeks away, Parliament is debating Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan, which it has already rejected twice by large margins, before a third vote on Friday afternoon.</h3><p>

    <h3> Lawmakers are to vote around 2:30 p.m. London time on the 585-page agreement, which details Britain’s relationship to the European Union through the end of 2020, while longer-term plans are sorted out.</h3><p>

    <h3> If it does not pass, as seems likely, Britain’s withdrawal is on track to take place on April 12 without an agreement — the “no-deal” Brexit that many economists and officials have warned would do serious economic damage.</h3><p>
